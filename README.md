## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

It was nothing really new here as most of the things I had to do at least a couple of times before. However, putting everything together made it more difficult. Some of the things I had to do here, I only encountered once or twice before. Such as using radio inputs and hiding them in order to get the appearance required. To achieve that I styled the labels instead. Overall it was great practice in JavaScript.

### Continued development

As I am feeling quite comfortable with HTML and CSS after doing several projects I can focus more on accessibility and JavaScript. JavaScript seems very intimidating but breaking a problem down into smaller pieces really helps. I need a lot of JavaScript practice and there's so many more things to learn.
